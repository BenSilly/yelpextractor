# yelpextractor

## Description

This program will call the yelp search API where it will gather data on a requested restaurant.  Then the ID is used to gather 3 reviews for that restaurant
and return the results in JSON.

This initial commit will mark the time I started development on this project.  Prior to this I have pushed a small amount of code that was generated by Spring Initializer.  This took all of 5 minutes and I did that to test my git/gradle/java/environment on my personal computer prior to taking this exam.

## Notes
I was not able to get to security/ input sanitization, logging, unit testing, integration testing, within the 3 hour time limit.  
If I were writing this for an enterprise level application I would not ship it without all of the above.
also I did not have time to attempt the extra credit assignment
